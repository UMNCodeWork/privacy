Privacy

Cryptoparty - May 9th, 2015 - TC Makerspace

### 4th Amendment:
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

* There's a bill in the MN legislature to amend this to include electronic communications

* **Third-Party Doctrine**: Principle that, if you route your information through a third party, then you don't have a reasonable expectation to privacy around that information.

* Here, privacy and security *are not* at odds with each other--unlike the duality they've become today.

* "Reasonableness" here is an ever-evolving concept.

### Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
Article 12. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.



"Everyone knows there is no privacy, but everyone still hopes for privacy" - Why the hope?  It must be important to humans in some way--but also highly contextual.


What is privacy? - our group's brainstorm
================
* Having control over what part of my life that I want others to know
* ... without raising suspicion that I'm doing something wrong or illicit
* The idea that I can know who the recipient of my information is (journalitic perspective)
* The agency to control whom you're associating/interacting with
* Private thought - individual thought without external influence
* Ability to "write your own story"
* Ability to not feel "invaded" - a gut feeling
* The right to act in the world without having to say what your name is


GitHub has an assumption of openness (which is free); if you want privacy, it's *paid*

Privacy makes people feel more confident when learning code; working in the open may feel more intimidating
(Moodle as a classroom metaphor)

"Domestic politics" vs "external politics" help us justify very different value codes for "internal" vs. "external"...but should it?


"Privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful" (Assange):
* How am I going to critique a person's behavior, if I don't know what they've done?  Public personas may justify different (lower) standards of privacy.
* Terry Gross lets all of her guests edit their material before releasing--*unless* they're a public figure.
* Open meeting laws for public figures


"Urban" anonymity may feel different from "small town" anonymity - it's all culturally relative


Does anyone communicate via a means where they feel they have a reasonable expectation of privacy?
* audio/video feels more private, because the overhead required to parse it seems too high...but for how long?
* privacy in obscurity...but for how long until search optimization improves?
